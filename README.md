# Age-and-Gender-detection
This is a robust model for real-time gender and age detection using data science, tailored for applications in customer service, security, and healthcare. Leveraging convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and the Adience dataset, we designed a scalable system that can accurately identify demographic attributes from facial images under diverse conditions. The model, implemented with OpenCV and Streamlit, processes static and real-time inputs, ensuring high adaptability for real-world scenarios. Key challenges addressed include optimizing model performance, managing data biases, upholding privacy standards, and positioning our solution as a significant advancement in demographic analysis.
